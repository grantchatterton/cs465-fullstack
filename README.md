# CS-465 - Full Stack Development I
CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Architecture
### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
#### Express HTML
Express HTML was used for serving static files from the web server. Before files are transfered to the client, the templating/view engine [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) processes given templating files (such as HTML), replacing marked contents with requested data. Consider something like the meals section of the main Travlr Getaways web page. When a user requests to view this page, first meals stored on the server are fetched, forwarded to the templating engine with the corresponding HTML file for processing, and then forwarded/rendered to the client.
#### JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for defining the functionality of a web page. Although intended for front-end/client-side development (for a user's web browser), it has been heavily adopted for use on the server-side through the use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). 

### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

## Functionality
### How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

## Testing
### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
